        <h2>Introduction to Computer Hardware</h2>
        <p>Computer hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system. Understanding the various hardware elements is fundamental in computer science and technology.</p>

        <h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
        <p>The CPU is the brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. It consists of an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and a control unit.</p>

        <h2>Memory and Storage</h2>
        <p>Memory and storage are essential components of a computer. RAM (Random Access Memory) provides temporary storage for running programs, while storage devices like hard drives and SSDs store data permanently.</p>

        <h2>Motherboard</h2>
        <p>The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects all the components of a computer. It houses the CPU, memory, and other essential hardware components.</p>

        <h2>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</h2>
        <p>A GPU is dedicated to rendering graphics and is crucial for tasks like gaming and graphical applications. Modern GPUs are highly parallel processors.</p>

        <h2>Input and Output Devices</h2>
        <p>Input devices, such as keyboards and mice, allow users to interact with the computer. Output devices, like monitors and printers, display information or produce results.</p>

        <h2>Networking Hardware</h2>
        <p>Networking hardware facilitates communication between computers. This includes routers, switches, and network interface cards (NICs).</p>

        <h2>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</h2>
        <p>The PSU converts electrical power from an outlet into a form suitable for the computer. It provides power to the motherboard and other components.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Understanding computer hardware is crucial for anyone in the field of computer science. It lays the foundation for developing and maintaining efficient and powerful computing systems.</p>

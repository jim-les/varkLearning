        <h2>Introduction to Software</h2>
        <p>Software refers to the set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform specific tasks. It is a critical component of computer science and enables the functionality of hardware.</p>

        <h2>Categories of Software</h2>
        <p>Software can be categorized into:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>System Software:</strong> Manages hardware components and provides essential services. Examples include operating systems like <code>Windows</code>, <code>Linux</code>, and <code>macOS</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Application Software:</strong> Designed for specific tasks or functions. Examples include word processors, web browsers, and video editing software.</li>
            <li><strong>Utility Software:</strong> Provides additional functionality, such as antivirus programs, disk cleanup tools, and file compression utilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
        <p>Programming languages allow developers to communicate instructions to a computer. Common programming languages include <code>Python</code>, <code>Java</code>, <code>C++</code>, and <code>JavaScript</code>.</p>

        <h2>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h2>
        <p>The SDLC is a series of steps followed during the development of software. It includes stages like planning, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.</p>

        <h2>Version Control Systems</h2>
        <p>Version control systems, such as <code>Git</code>, enable developers to track changes in their codebase, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if needed.</p>

        <h2>Software Testing</h2>
        <p>Testing is a crucial phase in software development. It includes unit testing, integration testing, and system testing to ensure the software meets the specified requirements.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Understanding software concepts is vital for computer science professionals. It involves not only writing code but also following best practices in software development to create robust and efficient applications.</p>
